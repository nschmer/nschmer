### Hi there!

My name is Natalie and I'm a second year M.S. student at Colorado State University in the Graduate Degree Program in Ecology

- 💧 I’m really interested in water quality and river ecosystem ecology, especially river ecosystem metabolism and drivers of metabolism dynamics (land use chage like 🌾 or 🏙️ , river channel alteration like dams)
- 💻 I love working with water data and am always looking for new ideas and methods for dataviz! 📊 📈 📉 (currently trying to learn rayshader for 3d rendering)
- 📫 How to reach me: email (nschmer@colostate.edu) or find me on Twitter (@NatKSchmer)
- 💁 Pronouns: she/her/hers
- ✨ Fun fact ✨ I majored in geology in undergrad and if I had to choose a different career I'd definitely be a volcanologist or work on geohazards 🌋
