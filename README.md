### Hey there!

My name is Natalie and I'm a hydrologist with the U.S. Geological Survey Pennsylvania Water Science Center through the Pathways Recent Graduate program. I graduated with my M.S. in Ecology from the Graduate Degree Program in Ecology at Colorado State University in 2021 and B.S. in Geology and Environmental sciences from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2019.

💧 I’m really interested in water quality and river ecosystem ecology, especially river ecosystem metabolism. In my masters I investigated drivers of metabolism dynamics (land use chage like 🌾 or 🏙️ , river channel alteration like dams) on longitudinal gradients.

💻 I love working with water data! I was involved in a really cool collaboration between CSU, the City of Fort Collins, and In-Situ, inc. where we installed a water quality sensor network and this project allowed me to develop some really important data skills like management, organization, analysis, and visualization -- I am always looking for new ideas and methods for dataviz! 📊 📈 📉 (currently trying to learn rayshader for 3d rendering)

🚴‍♀️ 🥾 📚 In my free time I love to bike, hike, and read (current book is Braiding Sweetgrass by Robin Wall Kimmerer)

✨ Fun fact ✨ I majored in geology in undergrad and if I had to choose a different career I'd definitely be a volcanologist or work on geohazards 🌋
