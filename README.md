### Hey there!

My name is Natalie and I'm a second year M.S. student at Colorado State University in the Graduate Degree Program in Ecology

💧 I’m really interested in water quality and river ecosystem ecology, especially river ecosystem metabolism. I currenly am investigating drivers of metabolism dynamics (land use chage like 🌾 or 🏙️ , river channel alteration like dams) on longitudinal gradients.  

💻 I love working with water data! I'm involved in a really cool collaboration between CSU, the City of Fort Collins, and In-Situ, inc. where we have installed a water quality sensor network and this project has allowed me to develop some really important data skills like management, organization, analysis, and visualization -- I am always looking for new ideas and methods for dataviz! 📊 📈 📉 (currently trying to learn rayshader for 3d rendering)

🚴‍♀️ 🥾 📚 In my free time I love to road bike, hike, and read (current book is Braiding Sweetgrass by Robin Wall Kimmerer)

✨ Fun fact ✨ I majored in geology in undergrad and if I had to choose a different career I'd definitely be a volcanologist or work on geohazards 🌋
